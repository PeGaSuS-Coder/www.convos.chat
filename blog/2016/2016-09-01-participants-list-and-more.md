So in Convos a "channel" is called a dialog, and "users" are called
"participants". But until now, there was no good way to see the participant
list for a channel. This is now changed: A "cog wheel" button, next to the
"notifications" button will now show dialog settings.

## Why can't I install this awesome application?

There was an issue installing Convos if you did not already have
`IO::Socket::SSL` installed. This SSL module was added to the
[dependency list](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/blob/master/cpanfile),
but that doesn't help much when the module is required to install itself...
The fix is to install modules over HTTP instead of HTTPS, until
`IO::Socket::SSL` is installed.

## But wait! There's more!

[Changes](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/blob/master/Changes) or have
a look at the [git history](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/commits/stable)
if you want all the details, but here are some highlights:

* Prevent showing join/part messages in all channels.
* Fix loading Convos on Windows Mobile.
* Fix parsing UTC time in Firefox.
* Add favicon.
* Add support for /kick and /mode IRC commands.
