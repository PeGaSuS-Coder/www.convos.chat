The [stable](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/tree/stable) branch has now
been updated with major bugfixes:

## Server didn't like my code regarding "unread" count

The "unread" count for the dialogs are now calculated on server side, instead
of in the browser. This is a far better solution than what was introduced in
[be445819cf01d22095b63e8a6dc10f3999c03d54](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/commit/be445819cf01d22095b63e8a6dc10f3999c03d54).
The problem with the previous solution was even worse than what I expected:
Seems like fetching participants and messages for a bunch of dialogs results
in either the server or browser to drop some of the requests. I could be
fooling myself, but that's what it looks like from browser dev console.

So now instead, the code does one `/api/user` request which retrieves the
connections, notifications and dialogs _with_ the unread count.  Later the
javascript lazy loads the messages from the backend when a dialog goes from
"inactive" to "active" state and also handles websocket reconnects.

## Participants where all over place

This was a pretty dumb bug, which would probably been avoided if there was any
unit tests for the vuejs/javascript code: There was two attributes tracking
the participants, but only one of them was actually in use when doing
autocomplete in the input field.

Which reminds me: Would very much appreciate
[help](http://localhost:4000/doc/#getintouch), regarding choosing a test
framework for the vuejs code.

## Send button to /dev/null

The "send button" next to the input field simply didn't work. This is fixed
now.

## Keep sending us those issue reports

[Denis Brækhus](https://github.com/denisbr) has been the first person to open
an issue regarding the new codebase on [github](https://github.com/convos-chat/convos/issues/266).
This is much appreciated! He also posted a question on
