This document is a work in progress, and some of the screenshots might be
inaccurate. Please submit a PR or let us know in the #convos channel on
[Libera](https://libera.chat/) if you think something is wrong or missing.

To see what Convos really support, we recommend trying out the
[demo](https://demo.convos.chat/register).

## Always online

Convos will keep you connected to a network, even if you close your browser.
This means you can come back later and see historic messages.

## Autocomplete

Convos feature autocompletion for commands, nicks, channels and emojis.

## Bot

Convos has a builtin bot. The bot has some core features listed in the link
below, but it can also be extended to cater your own needs.

* [Bot plugin](https://convos.chat/doc/Convos/Plugin/Bot)

## CMS

* [Convos as a document and blogging service](/blog/2020/6/3/content-management-system)

## Developer friendly

Want to contribute to Convos? The [Developement guide](/doc/develop) will get
you up and running. The backend is written in Perl, the frontend in common web
technologies, but if you don't know either you can still contribute with
documentation patches.

* [REST API](/api.html)
* [WebSocket API](/doc/Convos/Controller/Events)

## Easy to install

No need for external servers or complex config files to [get up and
running](/doc/start).

## File uploads

* [Merry Christmas and happy uploading!](/blog/2019/12/24/merry-christmas-and-happy-uploading)

## Notifications

Convos will show desktop notifications when your nick is mentioned, or if any
of the notification keywords are seen in a conversation. In addition, you can
also enable notifications for all messages in a channel, or turn off notifications
for a given private conversation.

## Privacy

We believe that you should be in control of your own data. This means that all
the messages, file uploads and other information is kept on your server, and
not shared with a third party.

## Quick search

Convos has a quick search input in the upper left corner. This allows you to
filter conversations, search for historic messages or show conversations with
unread messages.

* [FAQ](/doc/faq)

## Rich formatting

* Convos can render emojis and will automatically turn common ASCII smileys into
  graphical emojis.
* Messages starting with ">" will be rendered as a quote.
* Common markdown formatting for bold and italic is supported.
* URLs will automatically be clickable.
* URLs will be expanded directly in the chat, giving you a quick preview.
