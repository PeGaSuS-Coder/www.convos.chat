title: Running Convos behind my favorite web server
toc: true
---

Convos and the web server need to be configured properly and
[WebSockets](https://www.websocket.org/) need to be supported through the whole
chain.

## Start Convos with correct environment variables

The environment variable [`CONVOS_REVERSE_PROXY`](/doc/config#convos_reverse_proxy)
must be set to a true value.

    CONVOS_REVERSE_PROXY=1 ./script/convos daemon --listen http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Generic web server set up

The reverse proxy needs to pass on some HTTP headers to Convos, so correct URLs
will be generated. Here are the important headers:

* "Host" header must be set to the original request's "Host" header.
* "X-Forwarded-For" must be set for Convos to see the correct remote IP
* "X-Request-Base" header must be set to the root URL for Convos.

"X-Request-Base" must also have a path part if Convos is not mounted under "/",
and you *might* have to rewrite the incoming request.

## Example nginx config

Here is a complete example on how to start Convos with nginx:

    # Host and port where convos is running
    upstream convos_upstream { server 127.0.0.1:8080; }

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name your-domain.com;

      # Mount convos under http://your-domain.com/
      location / {

        # Pass requests on to the upstream defined above
        proxy_pass http://convos_upstream;

        # Instruct Convos to do the right thing regarding
        # HTTP and WebSockets
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";

        # http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size
        client_max_body_size 0;

        # Enable Convos to construct correct URLs by passing on custom headers.
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Request-Base "$scheme://$host/";
      }
    }

If "X-Request-Base" has a path part, then you must also add a "rewrite" rule:

    rewrite ^/whatever/convos/?(.*)$ /$1 break;
    proxy_set_header X-Request-Base "$scheme://$host/whatever/convos";

## Example Apache config

Here is a complete example on how to start Convos with Apache:

    &lt;VirtualHost your-domain.com:80>
      ServerAdmin admin@your-domain.com
      ServerName your-domain.com

      &lt;Proxy *>
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
      &lt;/Proxy>

      # Enable Convos to construct correct URLs by passing on custom headers.
      ProxyRequests Off
      ProxyPreserveHost On
      RequestHeader set X-Request-Base "http://your-domain.com/"

      # https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_remoteip.html
      RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For

      # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#limitrequestbody
      LimitRequestBody 0

      # Pass requests on to Convos
      ProxyPass /events ws://localhost:8080/events
      ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/ keepalive=On
      ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
    &lt;/VirtualHost>
